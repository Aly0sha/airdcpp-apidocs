## Communicating via HTTP

Using HTTP to communicate with the API is often the easiest solution for performing simple tasks.

### Basic authentication

The application supports [cookie-based basic HTTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) for API requests.

An example for refreshing the whole share with [curl](https://curl.haxx.se):

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -u myusername:mypassword http://localhost:5600/api/v1/share/refresh`

Note that a session object is still created internally by the application, so the methods available for [current session](/#reference/sessions/current-session) can still be used (such as if you need information about the current user permissions).


### Session-based authentication

Creating an unique session should generally be done only if you are going to use HTTP calls in conjuction with WebSockets.

Authentication happens through [Session API's authentication method](/#reference/sessions/authentication/create-session). Once you have sent the user credentials, you will receive the session token in the response message:

```json
    ....
    "auth_token": "25793d1e-6d48-407c-9c27-a9dcbd2e1188"
    ...
```

The token should be sent in the `Authorization` HTTP header when making requests:

```Authorization: 25793d1e-6d48-407c-9c27-a9dcbd2e1188```


## WebSockets

If your use case is simple, such as initiating share refreshes for directories downloaded from external sources, plain HTTP calls will be totally sufficient.

However, since the application is heavily based on bidirectional communication and long running operations (chatting, file transfers, share refreshes...), writing
of certain implementations will become significantly easier when the application is able to push information about new events to API consumers directly.

WebSockets are beneficial especially if at least one of the following conditions is met:

- There is an existing socket connector available for your scripting language
- Minimal latencies are important (such bidirectional chatting)
- You are developing a more complex integration

WebSockets may be used in conjunction with regular HTTP request or the sockets may also be used exclusively for all API communication.

Note that this section is used as a reference for low-level socket communication. Socket connectors, such as airdcpp-apisocket-js, will have their own abstactions for API communication.


### Connecting and authenticating WebSockets

You should use the following URL format when establishing WebSocket connections:

Unencrypted: `ws://<address>:<http port>/api/v1/`
Encrypted: `wss://<address>:<https port>/api/v1/`

WebSockets require an [unique session created via the Session API](/#introduction/http-calls/session-based-authentication) (basic HTTP authentication isn't sufficient).


#### Associating socket with an existing session

If only want to use WebSockets for receiving event messages and continue using regular HTTP calls for requests, you may associate the socket with an existing session instead:

```json
{
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/sessions/socket",
    "callback_id": 1,
    "data": { 
        "auth_token": "046f477f-3f09-45b6-8582-889d5fee0de7"
    }
}
```

Response: 

```json
{
    "code": 204,
    "callback_id": 1
}
```

#### Authentication through the socket

To create a new session directly via the socket, send the following message:

```json
{
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/sessions/authorize",
    "callback_id": 1,
    "data": { 
        "username": "myusername",
        "password": "mypassword"
    }
}
```

[Authentication method API reference](/#reference/sessions/authentication/create-session)


### API requests via WebSocket

You may use WebSockets exclusively for all API communication. The message structure emulates regular HTTP requests:

**Request**

```json
{
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/hubs/chat_message",
    "callback_id": 1,
    "data": { 
        "text": "Sent through WebSocket",
        "hub_urls": [ "adcs://myhub.com:4252" ]
    }
}
```

`callback_id` is an unique identifier (positive integer) for the request that you can use for identifying the correct response message. 
Responses may not be delivered in the same order as the requests were sent. Requests sent without `callback_id` will be processed but no responses are sent.

**Example response (success)**

```json
{
    "code": 200,
    "callback_id": 1,
    "data": { 
        "sent": 4
    }
}
```

**Example response (error)**

```json
{
    "code": 403,
    "callback_id": 1,
    "error": { 
        "message": "The permission hubs_send is required for using this method"
    }
}
```


### Event listeners

#### Generic listeners

The format for adding generic listeners is

`POST /<section>/listeners/<subscription name>`

Such as:

`POST /system/listeners/away_state`

An example event message for this event would be: 

```json
{
    "event": "away_state"
    "data": { 
        "id": "idle"
    }
}
```

The lis may be removed with

`DELETE /system/listeners/away_state`

Note that all added subscriptions will be reset when the socket gets disconnected.

Due to limitations of the current documentation framework, event messages are described as regular responses in the API reference section.
Demonstrated example responses will contain the `data` field content only instead of showing the full socket messages with event names and possible IDs.

#### Entity-based subscriptions

You may add subscriptions for certain individual entities (such as hubs and filelists):

`POST /hubs/0/listeners/hub_status_message`

In such cases event messages will also contain the entitity identifier for which the event was triggered:

```json
{
    "event": "hub_status_message",
    "id": 0,
    "data": {
        "text": "Connecting to adcs://myhub.com:5231 ...",
        "severity": "info"
    }
}
```

If you want to receive the event across all entities managing the subscriptions individually for each entity can become cumbersome. That's why the same listeners may also always be added without binding them to any specific entities:

`POST /hubs/listeners/hub_status_message`

The resulting event message will be the same as described earlier (entity IDs are still included for identification purposes).


### Action hooks

Action hooks allow scripts to perform validations related to various client actions, such as validate the content finished bundles/files or filter incoming chat messages. All events fired by the hook must either be accepted or rejected by the script before the application processes them futher.


#### Adding hooks

`POST /hubs/hooks/hub_incoming_message_hook`

Data (required):

```json
{
    "id": "simple_chat_filter",
    "name": "Chat message filter",
}
```

+ id: Hook subscriber ID, which should be globally unique across all sessions for a single hook so it's better avoid using too generic IDs (subscribers with the same ID can't be added simultaneously from multiple sessions). The ID should contain alphanumeric characters only.
+ name: Display name for the subscriber

It's not possible to add multiple subscribers for a single hook from within the same session.

#### Removing hooks

`DELETE /hubs/hooks/hub_incoming_message_hook`

#### Handling hook events

**Hook event format**

```json
{
    "completion_id": 1,
    "event": "hub_incoming_message_hook",
    "data": "(hook-specific data)"
}
```

*completion_id* should be put in the URL used for accepting/rejecting the event.


**Accepting the event**

`POST /hubs/hooks/hub_incoming_message_hook/1/resolve`


**Rejecting the event**

`POST /hubs/hooks/hub_incoming_message_hook/1/reject`

Data (required):

```json
{
    "reject_id": "filtered",
    "message": "Filter due to message matching the pattern ignoretest"
}
```

Data passed in the reject call is required and will be used for debugging purposes and, depending on the hook, may also be displayed to the user.

+ reject_id: Subscriber-specific reject ID
+ message: Display reason for the rejection

# Group Filelists

Filelist API allows browsing remote users' shared content or own share and manages queueing of directory downloads from other users. Note that filelist sessions are shared across API/UI sessions. Filelists of non-AirDC++ users will also contain less information about filelist directories/files.

API sessions use partial filelists so the content of each directory is downloaded only once it has been requested. Due to this, it may take some time when switching from one directory to another (especially when browsing remote NMDC filelists).

# Group Queue

The download queue in AirDC++ is organized in bundles. A single bundle generally represents the item that was originally queued and it may be either a file or a directory. 

The download order of queued bundles is determined based on their priorities.

### Directory bundles

The content of a queued directory bundle is not static. You may queue new files/directories inside existing bundles and they will be merged into it based on the target path. Existing items may also be removed.

Each file inside a directory bundle also has its own priority, that it being used to determine the file download order inside that particular bundle.

It's beneficial to keep the content size (file and directory count) of a single bundle reasonable. When queuing new directories, you should avoid creating individual bundles containing hundreds of directories. Queueing directories that can be assumed to be found from other users with about the same tree structure will make adding of alternative sources easier and ensure smoother application performance.

# Group Searching


## Introduction

Search matching in Direct Connect is a distibuted operation: search queries are sent to other hub users who match will match them against their own shared items. If you are in active connectivity
mode, they will send the possible search results directly to you via UDP (passive results are sent via hubs instead).

This also means that you can't simply just post a search and receive the results instantly as part of the response. Instead, you'll need to create a search instance for the search that will 
take care of collecting results of that particular search and keeps them available to be fetched later.

Basic code example for searching:

```javascript

// Create a new search instance
const instance = await api.post('search')

// Post the search
const searchInfo = await api.post(`search/${instance.id}/hub_search`, {
  query: {
    pattern: pattern,
  },
})

// Collect the results for 10 seconds before fetching them
await sleep(10000)

// Fetch the five most relevant results
const results = await api.get(`search/${instance.id}/results/0/5`)

// .... do something with them

```

(there are some caveats in the example that are explained later)

## Performance considerations

### Effect to hubs

When searching for "Ubuntu 14.04" with "iso" file extension in an ADC hub, the resulting protocol message that is being forwareded to all users by the hub would look similar to this:

`BSCH CLEF TO3/903088317 ANubuntu AN14.04 EXiso`

In a hub with 5000 users, the total amount of uncompressed data to be sent by the hub would be 230 kilobytes. If the searching user is in passive mode, all search forwarded replies would increase the total data amount even more.

### Effect to other users

There's a huge variation of share sizes among the users. The only metrics that matters in terms of search matching performance is user's total file/directory count. Matching a share with 10000 files won't be a big deal,
but the total matching time will be totally different with 5 million files.

TTH searches are generally cheap since clients maintain an index of shared files by their TTH values from which the searches are matched from. 

When performing text searches with partial matching, no such index exists. Various clients use [bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) to cheaply filter out text searches that are guaranteened not to match 
any shared items, that will work quite well especially with longer seach terms. If an average length of a shared item is 43 characters (43 bytes for ASCII-only names), the total amount of text to match with 5 million shared files
would be 215 megabytes (given that the whole share needs to matched).


## Search queues

Because of the performance considerations listed in the earlier section, hubs will generally limit the amount of searches that users may perform and spamming the hub with a large number of searches may cause the user 
to get kicked out. 

Searches performed by the client will originate from many different sources (manual searches, searches for alternate queue sources and API scripts...). In order to prevent a large number of searches being sent within a short amount of time, 
the application will maintain queues for outgoing searches on per-hub basis.

The position of a search in the search queue is determined by its priority, which allows minimizing the waiting times for more urgent searches (such as manual ones made from the UI).
Since higher priority searches may be added in queue before the existing ones, the actual time when the search will be sent is not known at the time when it's being queued.

When using Websockets, there's a 'search_hub_searches_sent' that will be fired after the search has been sent to all hubs. Here's a snippet of a subscription-based search function for [airdcpp-apisocket](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-apisocket-js):

```javascript

// Create a new search instance
const instance = await socket.post('search')

// Add listener for the 'searches sent' event before performing the actual search
socket.addListener(`search/${instance.id}`, 'search_hub_searches_sent', searchInfo => {
  // Collect the results for 5 seconds before fetching them
  await sleep(5000)
  
  // .... fetch and do something with them
})

// Perform the search
socket.post(`search/${instance.id}/hub_search`, {
  query: {
    pattern: pattern,
  },
  priority: 1, // Lowest (1-5)
})

```

[Complete example](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-apisocket-js/blob/master/examples/AutoDownloader.js)

HTTP users may also check the search instance object to see the current queue time or time ellapsed from the search.

Note that the application may also choose reject new searches in order to prevent the search queue from growing indefinitely. Therefore, you should
use some consideration regarding the number of searches that you really need to perform.

# Group Viewed files

## Fetching file content

All viewed files that have completed downloading can be accessed via HTTP by using the following URL:

`http(s)://<server address>/view/<file id>`

Authentication information is required for accessing the file. 
You may use the regular HTTP authorization header or alternatively add the query *`?auth_token=<authorization>`* after the URL.

Example:

`http://localhost:5600/view/ZMT6DPFKQGNGWO6I5Y6FKRHJJSL73DI5YAFGB6I?auth_token=417886b3-7419-48f1-a541-f308947db011`

Warning: 

Due to limitations of the embedded web server, the whole file content will be loaded in memory before uploading. This may cause stability issues
on systems with low amount of memory. Therefore, it's recommended to use this API for viewing relatively small files.
